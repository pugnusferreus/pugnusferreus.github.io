Love it or hate it, code reviews proved to be quite important in software development process. Project managers might think that code reviews are a waste of time because it'll prolong development time. Not to be confused with pair programming or pair review, code reviews are similar to GIT's pull request. For SVN, we can use softwares like <a href="https://www.reviewboard.org">Review Board</a> or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/upsource/">Upsource</a>.

Here are the 10 reasons that code reviews should be done in software development.

1. Programmers are humans, and humans make mistakes. It is good to have an extra pair of eyes to review our code.

2. We can learn each other's programming chops.

3. Most of the time, we'll be working on different modules. By doing code reviews, there will be spread of knowledge.

4. By being aware that our code will be reviewed by our peers, we'll be more conscious when we program hence, leading to better code quality.

5. Code review can also improve our communication skills. We'll have to be prepared to answer the questions that will be asked by your peers.

6. Possibly find more bugs related to scenarios that you never think of.

7. Effective training tool for junior developers.

8. Code reviews has virtually no risk and is a good risk management.

9. By giving constant feedback on the source level, we will stop making the same mistakes over and over again.
