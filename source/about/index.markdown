Me
</h2>

I work as a Senior Java Developer at Movideo. Movideo is a media centric online video platform (OVP). Over here, we’re pretty much dealing with Lucene, Hibernate, Spring, Struts and some analytics stuff. We’ve recently moved to the Microsoft Azure Platform. From this project, I’ve dipped my hands in C# and Python.

Back in 2002, I started out as a Visual Basic 6 programmer for a startup company. Back then I’m the only programmer in that company. Even though VB6 was painful, it did provide me with RAD tools. I was both the Software Architect and Software Developer for the startup. Some how, in my second job, I’ve managed to move into Java.

Java may not be the most beautiful language in the world, but it provides a more stable platform and the community emphasizes more on Software Architecture, Design and Best Practices. This is when I first heard of JUnit and started my voyage with Test Driven Development (TDD).

My Free Time

When I’m not spending time with my wife, I enjoy playing around with tech stuff and reading about software development. When I don’t feel like facing my computer or reading, I’ll be <a href="https://soundcloud.com/benson-cs-lim">playing/composing music</a> or go out for a run. Due to the Azure migration, I had to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro. And because of this, I’m back into PC gaming.......
